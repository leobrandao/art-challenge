# Considerations

App built considering the original requirements of the challenge. To the sake of simplicity, no extra complexity, features or functionalities were added to the scope of the project.

## Requirements:
    - Build a Kanban Like application with 4 different columns with a list of items based on the initial mocked data
    - Each Column should have its own button for adding new item to its list
    - The new item information should be captured from the dialague using window.promt
    - Items can be moved from its current column to a next or previous (if any) column using left and right arrows
